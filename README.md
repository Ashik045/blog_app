# journal
Journal is similar to a social media application.

This application is fully responsive. I'm using CSS grid for responsiveness, SASS for design pattern, and SWEETALERT2 for some simple login, and logout alerts. I'm using Reactjs for the front-end. And for back-end there are Nodejs with his Expressjs framework. For the database I'm using MongoDB. 
There is both client-side and server-side validation in this application.
