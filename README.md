# journal
Journal is similar to a social media application.

This application is fully responsive. I'm using CSS grid for responsiveness, SASS for design pattern, and SWEETALERT2 for some simple login, and logout alerts. I'm using Reactjs for the front-end. And for the back-end there are Nodejs with his Expressjs framework. For the database I'm using MongoDB. 
There is both client-side and server-side validation in this application.

After authentication authenticated users can post their travel stories and read others travel experiences. After creating a post user can update his post and also can delete the post.  Users also can update their profile(profile picture, username, email, password).
